## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- `PySide6` - Modern Qt6-based GUI framework
- `cryptography` - Industry-standard cryptographic library
- `pyperclip` - Clipboard operations
- `Pillow` - Image processing and validation

### Setup
1. Clone or download the application files
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv enigma_env
   source enigma_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: enigma_env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Text Encryption/Decryption
1. Enter text in the input field
2. Select "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" from the operation dropdown
3. Click "Process Text" and enter your passphrase
4. Choose "Copy to Clipboard" or "Copy to File" for output
5. Click "Execute Action" to complete the operation

### File Encryption/Decryption
1. Click "Add Files" to select files for processing
2. Files appear in the table with name, size, and type
3. Select files and click "Remove Selected" if needed
4. Choose "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" from the operation dropdown
5. Click "Process Files" and enter your passphrase
6. Each file will prompt for a save location (manual control)

### Audit Log
- Click "Audit Log" to view operation history
- Logs show timestamps, actions, outcomes, and file hashes
- Export logs to JSON format with optional encryption
- Clear logs when needed (with confirmation)

## Security Architecture

### Cryptographic Implementation
```
Passphrase ‚Üí PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (480k iterations) ‚Üí Encryption Key + HMAC Key
                                                   ‚Üì
Data ‚Üí AES-256-GCM (unique nonce) ‚Üí Ciphertext + Auth Tag
                                   ‚Üì
Final Package: Salt + Nonce + Ciphertext + Auth Tag + HMAC
```

### Key Security Features
- **No key reuse** - unique salt and nonce for every operation
- **Memory protection** - sensitive data wiped after use
- **Tamper detection** - HMAC verification prevents data modification
- **Filename obfuscation** - original names hidden using SHA-256 hashing
- **Audit trail** - all operations logged without sensitive data

### Compliance Standards
- **NIST SP 800-63B** - Digital identity guidelines
- **NIST SP 800-57** - Cryptographic key management
- **OWASP Cryptographic Storage** - Secure data storage practices

- **Cloud Messaging** - Optional secure communication features
- **Email Export** - Encrypted message export capability

### Development Roadmap
1. TOTP authentication system
2. PyInstaller packaging for Windows
3. BeeWare/Briefcase for Android deployment
4. Optional cloud integration hooks
5. Enhanced audit log encryption

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices
- Use strong, unique passphrases for each operation
- Verify file integrity after decryption
- Regularly review audit logs for suspicious activity
- Keep the application updated with security patches
- Use in air-gapped environments for maximum security

### Limitations
- Python memory management limits secure deletion effectiveness
- GUI framework may cache some display data temporarily
- File system may retain deleted file fragments
- Network isolation recommended for sensitive operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors** - Ensure all dependencies are installed in virtual environment
2. **GUI Not Displaying** - Check PySide6 installation and system compatibility
3. **Decryption Failures** - Verify passphrase and file integrity
4. **File Permission Errors** - Run with appropriate file system permissions

### Debug Mode
Set environment variable for verbose logging:
```bash
export ENIGMA_DEBUG=1  # Linux/Mac
set ENIGMA_DEBUG=1     # Windows
python main.py
```
